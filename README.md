# Skin Cancer Classification Model

## Overview
This project is designed to help detect different types of skin cancer using deep learning techniques. The model uses ResNet to classify images into seven distinct cancer types, assisting medical professionals in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Features
- Uses ResNet for high-accuracy classification.
- Processes medical image datasets to detect skin cancer.
- Provides a scalable approach for dermatological analysis.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- ResNet
- Machine Learning
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Anirudh0314m/skin-cancer-classifier.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd skin-cancer-classifier
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
- Train the model using skin lesion datasets.
- Evaluate and validate the model's performance.
- Deploy the model for automated classification of skin lesions.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve classification accuracy with larger datasets.
- Deploy as a web application for remote diagnosis.
